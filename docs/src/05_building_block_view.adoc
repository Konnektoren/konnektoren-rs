== Building Block View

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image::05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-5/[Building Block View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Whitebox Overall System

The Konnektoren project is organized into a workspace containing multiple crates, each representing a different part of the system's functionality. The following PlantUML diagram provides an overview of the top-level building blocks and their dependencies.

----

package "Konnektoren Workspace" {
    [konnektoren-core] as Core
    [konnektoren-tests] as Tests
    [konnektoren-tui] as TUI
    [konnektoren-yew] as Yew
}

Core --> Tests : used by
Core --> TUI : used by
Core --> Yew : used by
----

Motivation::

This decomposition allows for modular development and testing of each part of the system. The core functionalities are implemented in the `konnektoren-core` crate, which is then utilized by the TUI and Yew crates for different user interfaces. The `konnektoren-tests` crate ensures that all components are thoroughly tested.

Contained Building Blocks::

|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| konnektoren-core | Contains the core logic and functionalities of the Konnektoren project.
| konnektoren-tests | Contains tests for the core functionalities and other crates.
| konnektoren-tui | Provides a text user interface for the Konnektoren project.
| konnektoren-yew | Provides a web frontend using the Yew framework.
|===

Important Interfaces::

The primary interfaces between these building blocks are the function calls and API contracts defined in the `konnektoren-core` crate, which are utilized by the TUI and Yew crates to provide user interfaces.

==== konnektoren-core

Purpose/Responsibility::
The `konnektoren-core` crate is responsible for implementing the main logic and functionalities of the Konnektoren project, such as handling grammar challenges, tracking user progress, and managing gamification elements.
