=== Whitebox Overall System

The Konnektoren project is organized into a workspace containing multiple crates, each representing a different part of the system's functionality. The following PlantUML diagram provides an overview of the top-level building blocks and their dependencies.

System_Boundary(konnektoren_workspace, "Konnektoren Workspace") {
    Container(core, "konnektoren-core", "Rust Crate", "Contains the core logic and functionalities of the Konnektoren project")
    Container(tests, "konnektoren-tests", "Rust Crate", "Contains tests for the core functionalities and other crates")
    Container(tui, "konnektoren-tui", "Rust Crate", "Provides a text user interface for the Konnektoren project")
    Container(yew, "konnektoren-yew", "Rust Crate", "Provides a web frontend using the Yew framework")
}

Rel(tui, core, "Uses")
Rel(yew, core, "Uses")

Motivation::

This decomposition allows for modular development and testing of each part of the system. The core functionalities are implemented in the `konnektoren-core` crate, which is then utilized by the TUI and Yew crates for different user interfaces. The `konnektoren-tests` crate ensures that all components are thoroughly tested.

Contained Building Blocks::

|===

==== konnektoren-core

Purpose/Responsibility::
The `konnektoren-core` crate is responsible for implementing the main logic and functionalities of the Konnektoren project, such as handling grammar challenges, tracking user progress, and managing gamification elements.

==== konnektoren-yew

Purpose/Responsibility::
The `konnektoren-yew` crate is responsible for providing a web-based user interface for the Konnektoren project using the Yew framework.

=== Level 2: Challenge Rating System

The challenge rating system is a crucial part of the Konnektoren project, allowing users to provide feedback on challenges and view aggregate ratings.

Person(user, "User", "A user of the Konnektoren system")

System_Boundary(konnektoren, "Konnektoren System") {
    Container(frontend, "Frontend", "Rust, Yew", "Provides the user interface for interacting with challenges and submitting ratings")
    Container(backend, "Backend API", "Rust, Axum", "Handles API requests and manages data")
    ContainerDb(database, "Database", "Redis", "Stores challenge data, user ratings, and reviews")
}

Rel(user, frontend, "Views challenges, submits ratings and reviews")
Rel(frontend, backend, "Sends ratings/reviews, requests average ratings", "HTTP/JSON")
Rel_Neighbor(backend, database, "Reads from and writes to")
Rel_Back(frontend, user, "Displays average ratings")
@enduml
----

Motivation::
This architecture allows for a clear separation of concerns between the user interface, business logic, and data storage. It enables efficient collection and retrieval of user feedback, which can be used to improve the quality of challenges and enhance the user experience.

Contained Building Blocks::

|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| Frontend | Provides the user interface for viewing challenges, submitting ratings/reviews, and displaying average ratings.
| Backend API | Processes incoming ratings/reviews, retrieves average ratings, and manages communication with the Redis database.
| Database | Stores all challenge-related data, including user ratings and reviews, using Redis for fast data access.

=== Level 3: Frontend Components

This level provides a more detailed view of the frontend components in the Konnektoren Yew application.
