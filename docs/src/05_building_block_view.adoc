== Building Block View

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image::05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-5/[Building Block View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Whitebox Overall System

The Konnektoren project is organized into a workspace containing multiple crates, each representing a different part of the system's functionality. The following PlantUML diagram provides an overview of the top-level building blocks and their dependencies.

[plantuml, konnektoren-building-blocks, png]
----

package "Konnektoren Workspace" {
    [konnektoren-core] as Core
    [konnektoren-tests] as Tests
    [konnektoren-tui] as TUI
    [konnektoren-yew] as Yew
}

Core --> Tests : used by
Core --> TUI : used by
Core --> Yew : used by
----

Motivation::

This decomposition allows for modular development and testing of each part of the system. The core functionalities are implemented in the `konnektoren-core` crate, which is then utilized by the TUI and Yew crates for different user interfaces. The `konnektoren-tests` crate ensures that all components are thoroughly tested.

Contained Building Blocks::

|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| konnektoren-core | Contains the core logic and functionalities of the Konnektoren project.
| konnektoren-tests | Contains tests for the core functionalities and other crates.
| konnektoren-tui | Provides a text user interface for the Konnektoren project.
| konnektoren-yew | Provides a web frontend using the Yew framework.
|===

Important Interfaces::

The primary interfaces between these building blocks are the function calls and API contracts defined in the `konnektoren-core` crate, which are utilized by the TUI and Yew crates to provide user interfaces.

==== konnektoren-core

Purpose/Responsibility::
The `konnektoren-core` crate is responsible for implementing the main logic and functionalities of the Konnektoren project, such as handling grammar challenges, tracking user progress, and managing gamification elements.

==== Challenge Rating System

The challenge rating system is a crucial part of the Konnektoren project, allowing users to provide feedback on challenges and view aggregate ratings. The following C4 Container diagram illustrates the main components involved in this functionality:

This diagram shows the main components of the challenge rating system:

1. User: Represents the end-user of the Konnektoren system.
2. Frontend: Built with Rust and Yew, provides the user interface for interacting with challenges, submitting ratings/reviews, and viewing average ratings.
3. Backend API: Implemented in Rust with Axum, handles API requests, processes ratings/reviews, and manages data flow.
4. Database: Redis database that stores challenge data, user ratings, and reviews.

The arrows in the diagram indicate the flow of data between these components, demonstrating how ratings are submitted, retrieved, and displayed back to the user.

Motivation::
This architecture allows for a clear separation of concerns between the user interface, business logic, and data storage. It enables efficient collection and retrieval of user feedback, which can be used to improve the quality of challenges and enhance the user experience. The use of Redis as the database provides fast read and write operations, which is beneficial for real-time rating updates.

Contained Building Blocks::

|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| Frontend | Provides the user interface for viewing challenges, submitting ratings/reviews, and displaying average ratings.
| Backend API | Processes incoming ratings/reviews, retrieves average ratings, and manages communication with the Redis database.
| Database | Stores all challenge-related data, including user ratings and reviews, using Redis for fast data access.
|===

Important Interfaces::
- Frontend to Backend API: HTTP/JSON interface for submitting ratings/reviews and requesting average ratings.
- Backend API to Database: Redis commands for reading and writing rating data.
- Frontend to User: Visual interface for displaying average ratings and collecting user input.

This challenge rating system integrates with the overall Konnektoren system, particularly with the `konnektoren-yew` crate for the frontend implementation and the `konnektoren-core` crate for core business logic related to challenges and user interactions. The use of Axum in the backend aligns with the project's use of Rust throughout the stack, providing a consistent development experience and leveraging Rust's performance and safety features.
