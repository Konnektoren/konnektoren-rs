The quality tree breaks down key quality goals of the *konnektoren.help* project, categorized into performance, security, scalability, usability, and maintainability.

=== Quality Scenarios

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Quality Attribute |Scenario Description

|**Performance**
|The system must respond to user interactions (e.g., open a challenge or updating the leaderboard) within 1 second in 95% of cases.

|**Security**
|User data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest. The system must verify certificates using digital signatures to ensure data authenticity.

|**Scalability**
|The system should scale to handle up to 1,000 concurrent users without significant degradation in performance.

|**Usability**
|The web and Telegram apps must have an intuitive interface. Users should be able to create challenges and view leaderboards with minimal guidance.

|**Maintainability**
|The system's core library and UI components should be modular, allowing new features or bug fixes to be added without impacting existing functionality.

=== Detailed Quality Requirements

==== Performance

* The system uses WebAssembly (WASM) to ensure near-native performance in the browser.
* Cloudflare's CDN is utilized to minimize latency for static assets.
* The core library is optimized for efficiency, with careful consideration given to algorithmic complexity.

==== Security

* All user data is encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
* HTTPS is enforced for all communications to ensure data integrity and confidentiality in transit.
* Certificate verification uses Ed25519 signatures to prevent forgery.
* The system follows a principle of minimal server-side data storage to reduce potential attack surfaces.

==== Scalability

* The serverless architecture allows for automatic scaling based on demand.
* The use of GitHub Pages for static content hosting provides excellent scalability for the front-end.
* The leaderboard service is containerized, allowing for easy horizontal scaling.

==== Usability

* The UI is designed with responsive web design principles to ensure a consistent experience across devices.
* Gamification elements are incorporated to increase user engagement and motivation.
* Regular user testing and feedback loops are part of the development process to continually improve usability.

==== Maintainability

* The codebase follows Rust's official style guide to ensure consistency.
* Modular architecture allows for easy updates and feature additions.
* Comprehensive unit and integration tests are maintained to catch regressions early.
* Documentation is treated as a first-class citizen, with inline documentation for all public APIs.
