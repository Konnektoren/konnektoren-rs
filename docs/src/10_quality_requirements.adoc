The quality tree breaks down key quality goals of the *konnektoren.help* project, categorized into performance, security, scalability, usability, and maintainability.

=== Quality Scenarios

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Quality Attribute |Scenario Description

|**Performance**
|The system must respond to user interactions (e.g., open a challenge or updating the leaderboard) within 1 second in 95% of cases.

|**Security**
|User data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest. The system must verify certificates using digital signatures to ensure data authenticity.

|**Scalability**
|The system should scale to handle up to 1,000 concurrent users without significant degradation in performance.

|**Usability**
|The web and Telegram apps must have an intuitive interface. Users should be able to create challenges and view leaderboards with minimal guidance.

|**Maintainability**
|The system's core library and UI components should be modular, allowing new features or bug fixes to be added without impacting existing functionality.
