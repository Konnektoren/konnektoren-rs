.Contents
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies that shape system architecture. It includes

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g., usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions, e.g., selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

.Motivation
These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the foundation for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

.Form
Keep the explanations of such key decisions short.

Motivate what was decided and why it was decided that way,
based upon problem statement, quality goals, and key constraints.
Refer to details in the following sections.

.Further Information
See https://docs.arc42.org/section-4/[Solution Strategy] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Technology Decisions

**Web-Based Platform:**
To ensure accessibility and ease of maintenance, Konnektoren is designed as a web-based platform. This approach allows users to access the system across various devices without the need for native applications.

**Rust and Yew Framework:**
We chose Rust due to its performance, reliability, and robust type system. The Yew framework supports creating interactive UIs with WebAssembly, offering a reactive framework that is ideal for complex user interfaces like those required by Konnektoren.

=== Architectural Decisions

**GitHub Pages Hosting:**
The front-end application is hosted on GitHub Pages, providing a cost-effective and scalable solution for serving static content. This choice aligns with our goal of minimizing operational costs while ensuring high availability.

**SPA (Single Page Application):**
The front end is built as a SPA, which interacts with the back-end services via RESTful APIs. This choice supports a seamless and responsive user experience by reducing page reloads and dynamically updating the user interface.

**Serverless Architecture:**
The system is designed as a serverless architecture to reduce operational overhead and improve scalability. By leveraging cloud services like Cloudflare Workers, we can focus on developing features rather than managing infrastructure.

**Cloudflare Proxy:**
Cloudflare Workers are used as a proxy to secure the communication between the front end and back end, providing an additional layer of security and performance optimization. This decision aligns with our security and performance goals.

=== Achieving Quality Goals

**Usability and User Engagement:**
To achieve high usability, the UI/UX is designed to be intuitive and engaging, leveraging gamification techniques to motivate learners. Regular user testing ensures that the interface meets the needs of the target audience.

**Reliability and Scalability:**
Using cloud-based services and modern DevOps practices ensures that the system is both reliable and scalable. Automated testing and deployment facilitate continuous improvement and responsiveness to user demands.

=== Organizational Decisions

**Agile Development Process:**
The project adopts an Agile methodology to allow for flexibility in development and to incorporate feedback efficiently. This process supports iterative development and continuous improvement, aligning with our quality goals.
