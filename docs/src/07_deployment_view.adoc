[WASM Page] --> [Cloudflare Proxy] : Deployed through GitHub Pages
[Cloudflare Proxy] --> [Axum Server] : Proxy REST API calls to the leaderboard

@enduml
....

Motivation::

The *konnektoren.help* project uses a decentralized deployment model. The front-end is deployed as a static WASM page hosted on GitHub Pages, with Cloudflare acting as a proxy for secure, global content delivery. The back-end leaderboard service is a Docker container running an Axum server, communicating via REST API.

Quality and/or Performance Features::

- The Cloudflare proxy provides enhanced performance by caching static assets and offering DDoS protection.
- Using Docker for the Axum server enables containerized, reproducible, and scalable deployments.

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure::

- *WASM Page* is deployed on *GitHub Pages* behind the *Cloudflare Proxy*.
- *Axum Server* is deployed inside a *Docker Container* and handles the leaderboard functionality through REST API.
- Cloudflare is responsible for routing traffic and optimizing delivery for the WASM page.
- REST API is used to connect the WASM front-end with the leaderboard server.

=== Infrastructure Level 2

==== _GitHub Pages Infrastructure_

_**GitHub Pages Hosting Diagram**_

@startuml github-pages-deployment
node "GitHub Infrastructure" {
  [GitHub Pages] <<Static Hosting>>
}

node "User Browser" {
  [WASM Page]
}

[User Browser] --> [GitHub Pages] : Access hosted page

@enduml
....

The WASM front-end is deployed on GitHub Pages and accessed by users through their browsers. GitHub Pages hosts the static WASM content and serves it globally.

==== _Axum Server in Docker_

_**Axum Server Deployment Diagram**_

[plantuml, axum-server-deployment, svg]
....
@startuml axum-server-deployment
node "Server Infrastructure" {
  node "Docker Host" {
    [Axum Server] <<Docker Container>>
  }
}

node "Leaderboard Database" {
  [Database] <<External System>>
}

[Axum Server] --> [Database]
@enduml
....

The Axum server, running in a Docker container, handles leaderboard functionalities. It communicates with the leaderboard database.
