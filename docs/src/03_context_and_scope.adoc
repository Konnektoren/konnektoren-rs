== Context and Scope

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Context and scope - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.

.Further Information
See https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/[Context and Scope] in the arc42 documentation.

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the Konnektoren system, showing the main components and their interactions. The user interacts with the system through Cloudflare, which serves as a CDN and proxy. The frontend, built with Yew and WebAssembly, is hosted on GitHub Pages. The Konnektoren Core contains the business logic and game mechanics. The Leaderboard Service, running in a Docker container, manages user rankings and scores, interacting with both the frontend and core components.

=== Business Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.
Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

| Communication Partner | Inputs to System | Outputs from System
| Users | User registration data, grammar test answers | Learning progress, feedback

**Explanation of external domain interfaces**

The system interfaces with individual users. It receives data such as user registration details and test responses, and outputs learning progress and detailed analytical reports.

=== Technical Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition, a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems, together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

**Explanation of technical interfaces**

The technical architecture leverages modern web protocols to ensure secure and efficient data transmission. User data and responses are transmitted over HTTPS, ensuring privacy and security. Detailed reports and learning progress are also transmitted over HTTPS.
