== Testing Strategy

=== Overview

The Konnektoren project employs a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure the reliability, correctness, and performance of the system. Our approach includes various levels of testing, from unit tests to end-to-end tests, to cover different aspects of the application.

=== Levels of Testing

==== Unit Tests

* *Purpose*: Verify the correctness of individual functions and methods.
* *Tools*: Rust's built-in testing framework
* *Location*: Implemented alongside the code in the same files, typically in a `tests` module at the bottom of each Rust file.
* *Coverage*: Aim for high coverage (>80%) of all core functionality.

==== Integration Tests

* *Purpose*: Test the interaction between different modules and components.
* *Tools*: Rust's built-in testing framework, with tests in separate files
* *Location*: In the `tests` directory of each crate
* *Coverage*: Focus on key interactions and workflows between modules

==== End-to-End Tests

* *Purpose*: Validate complete user scenarios and workflows
* *Tools*: Cucumber for Rust (cucumber-rs)
* *Location*: In the `konnektoren-tests` crate, under `tests/features`
* *Coverage*: Key user journeys and critical business scenarios

=== Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

We use Cucumber for Rust to implement BDD tests, which serve as both documentation and functional tests. These tests are written in Gherkin syntax and cover high-level user scenarios.

Example feature file (`konnektoren-tests/tests/features/challenge.feature`):

[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: Challenge

  Scenario: Loading a default challenge from YAML
    Given default challenge is loaded
    Then it should be a MultipleChoice challenge named "Konnektoren"
    And it should have exactly 5 options
    And it should have at least 1 questions
----

=== Performance Testing

* *Tools*: Custom benchmarking tools built with Rust's `criterion` crate
* *Focus*: Key operations like challenge loading, solving, and leaderboard updates
* *Frequency*: Run as part of the CI/CD pipeline for each release

=== Security Testing

* *Static Analysis*: Use of `cargo audit` to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
* *Fuzz Testing*: Employ `cargo fuzz` for critical parsing and data handling functions
* *Manual Penetration Testing*: Conducted periodically on the deployed application

=== Continuous Integration

* All tests are run as part of our CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
* The pipeline includes running unit tests, integration tests, and BDD scenarios
* Code coverage reports are generated and tracked to ensure maintenance of high test coverage

=== Test Data Management

* Test data for challenges is stored in YAML files in the `assets` directory
* Mocked data for integration and E2E tests is generated programmatically or stored in fixture files

=== Future Improvements

* Implement property-based testing using the `proptest` crate for more robust unit tests
* Expand end-to-end test coverage to include more complex user scenarios
* Introduce load testing to verify system performance under high concurrency

By following this comprehensive testing strategy, we aim to maintain high quality and reliability in the Konnektoren system, enabling confident and frequent releases.
